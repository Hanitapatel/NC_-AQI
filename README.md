# Team4-FinalProject
Bootcamp Team4 Final project

### Chosen Topic
* Using various tools, we are looking to predict Air Quality in regions across North Carolina on a day to day basis to help populations with respiratory illnesses determine if it is safe for them to be outside. 
* Build a model that can, based on previous patterns and data, determine if the air quality is safe, for various populations 

### Why North Carolina AQI?
* Our goal is to help people with respiratory illnesses determine if it is safe for them to go outside from the safety of their home and with the ability at their fingertips 
* Help people/families with respiratory illnesses looking to move to North Carolina determine what region might suit them and their medical needs best

### Dataset 
* The dataset, “US Air Quality 1980-Present: Daily AQI Values from stations across the US,”  was found on Kaggle and can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/calebreigada/us-air-quality-1980present)
* •	The dataset contains the Air quality data from various stations across the United States. For this project we have selected to use only data from North Carolina testing stations

### Questions we are aiming to answer
* Do certain times of the year have better air quality than others?
* What AQI is safe/unsafe for a person with a respiratory illness?
* Does population density have an effect on AQI?
* Does location have an effect on AQI?
